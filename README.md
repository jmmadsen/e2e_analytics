# vault_react_ui
* React UI
* Node.js Express API
* Mongo DB
* Postgresql

## General Notes

I have included the React UI and an API in here for connecting to MongoDB and Postgres. I also included a docker-compose file for deploying into the cloud. The most important piece of this is the UI foundation, so if needed the `user_interface` directory can be pulled out and refactored accordingly.

This entire application is currently using self-built JWT auth. The API sends a cookie to the browser, which then is used to access protected routes in the API. If a route returns a 401 or 403, the axios interceptor in the client will redirect you to the login page. This is an *okay* method of authentication, not sure how particular we want to be in the code challenge.

When deploying, make sure to update the axios.defaults.baseURL to the cloud URL in `App.js` in the client. This is compiled at build time, and cannot be controlled by an environment variable.

It is assumed the User Interface does not need to be optimized for mobile. If it does, additional attention will need to be paid to the React-Bootstrap Layout objects and sizings.

## Running Locally

### user_interface

1. Add a `.env` under the `user_interface` directory that includes:

* REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

2. run `npm install` inside `user_interface`

3. run `npm start` inside `user_interface`

### api

1. Add a `.env` under the `api` directory that includes:

* NODE_ENV=development
* CRA_URL=http://localhost:3000
* MONGODB_URL=mongodb://admin:admin@localhost:27017
* JWT_SECRET=WeNeedABetterSecretThanThisInProd
* PORT=8080

2. run `npm install` inside `api`

3. run `npm start` inside `api`

### Mongo DB

1. make sure you have Docker running

2. run `docker run -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=vault_db -p 27017:27017 mongo`

### Postgresql

1. make sure you have Docker running

2. TBD
